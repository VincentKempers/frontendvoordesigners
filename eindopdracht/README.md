# Spotify connection
I use a Spotify connection to get acces to your playlist.

Because of this you can edit your playlist within my application.

## steps
- press the log in button to log in
- When logged in you will need to pick a playlist to edit.
- then you will be ready to edit and move the order.
- Then you can save the playlist.


# installation
- clone the repo
- then install the dependencies `npm install`
- when installed you can run the application with `node app.js`.
